To begin, I will clear workspace:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Next, I will load the packages that I will use for preprocessing and analysis:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
bicycle_trips <- read_excel("bicycle_trips.xlsx")
```

```{r}
save(bicycle_trips, file = "bicycle_trips.RData")
```

# My-First-Repository
This is my first repository

# Purpose of Repository

My name is Elise Desjardins and I created this repository and READMe as an exercise for GEO 712, a graduate-level seminar course at McMaster University taught by Dr. Antonio Paez and Krysha Dukacz.

# Cloning to Desktop

I learned how to clone this file and launch in my desktop. I am now able to make changes locally, like adding these paragraphs, in R Studio. I can save the file, commit the changes, and then push back to GitHub repository.

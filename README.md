# My-First-Repository
This is my first repository

# Purpose of Repository

I created this repository and READMe as an exercise for GEO 712, a graduate-level seminar course taught by Dr. Antonio Paez and Krysha Dukacz.

# Cloning to Desktop

I have now cloned this file and launched in my desktop. I am now able to make edits, like adding this paragraphs, in R Studio.
